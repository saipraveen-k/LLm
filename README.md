# LLM-Based Intelligent Document Understanding System

This project implements a **Large Language Model (LLM)-powered system** to process natural language queries and retrieve relevant information from unstructured documents such as **PDFs, DOCX, and emails**. It enables efficient query evaluation with structured outputs and justifications.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts and processes data from **PDF, DOCX, and email files**  
- Supports **natural language queries**  
- Retrieves **relevant clauses/sections** based on user query  
- Provides **structured decision outputs with justifications**  
- Built with **Python and modern NLP/LLM techniques**

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saipraveen-k/LLm.git
   cd LLm

▶️ Usage
Run the system with:

bash
Copy code
python src/llm_query.py --query "What are the conditions for insurance claim approval?"
📊 Example Output
Query: "What are the conditions for claim rejection?"
Answer:

The claim is invalid if submitted after 30 days of the incident.

Required documents such as FIR and hospital records are missing.

Justification: Extracted from sections 2.1 and 3.4 of the insurance policy document.

📌 Future Enhancements
Integration with vector databases (FAISS/ChromaDB)

Web-based query interface

Fine-tuned domain-specific LLMs
